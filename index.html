                <p>Just like my name, I'm a rare breed - no
                    average creative Joe (okay, maybe a smidge
                    better XD)
                    Doing the grind, waiting for that degree.
                    Juggling fine arts, philosophy, consumer
                    behavior, and economics - because why
                    settle for one?

                <p>II'm all about the diverse pool of knowledge
                    —maybe not the deepest, but I'm swimming
                    in everything. Plus, I find joy in diving into
                    the virtual realms, loving the thrill of
                    playing video games.
